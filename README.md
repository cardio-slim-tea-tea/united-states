## Real Ingredients in Cardio Slim Tea – A Breakdown of the Formula

What sets Cardio Slim Tea apart is its powerful blend of 100% natural and clinically backed ingredients. Here's a closer look at each one and how it supports your health:

**1. Beetroot Powder**

Rich in nitrates, beetroot helps lower homocysteine levels and reduces blood pressure. It also boosts nitric oxide production, improving circulation and vascular health.

**2. Decaffeinated Green Tea**

Green tea is well-known for its metabolism-boosting properties. In decaffeinated form, it helps with belly fat reduction and blood pressure regulation without overstimulating the nervous system.

**3. Hibiscus Flowers**

A potent antioxidant, hibiscus can lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and support homocysteine metabolism, an important factor in heart health.

**4. Ginger Root**

Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory that helps reduce systolic blood pressure and may lower the risk of coronary artery disease.

**5. Oolong Tea**

A traditional Chinese tea, oolong has been shown to aid in weight loss, boost metabolism, and lower hypertension over time.

**6. Chamomile**

Chamomile is calming for both the mind and the body. It supports lower blood pressure and blood sugar, and may also assist with appetite regulation.

**7. Dandelion Leaves**

A natural diuretic, dandelion helps reduce fluid retention and supports vasodilation, helping blood vessels relax and expand for better circulation.

**8. Hawthorn Berries**

Long used in herbal medicine for heart health, hawthorn reduces blood pressure, strengthens blood vessels, and improves heart function.

**9. Lemongrass**

Known for its cleansing properties, lemongrass helps reduce water weight, eases digestion, and may mildly support fat metabolism.

**10. TMG (Trimethylglycine)**

TMG is a methyl donor that helps decrease homocysteine levels, which is important for preventing cardiovascular inflammation and normalizing blood pressure.

**11. Grapeseed Extract**

This antioxidant-rich extract helps reduce blood pressure and boost HDL (good) cholesterol, supporting both heart and metabolic health.

**12. Ginseng Root**

Ginseng boosts energy levels, combats fatigue, and supports healthy blood pressure and mental focus.

**13. Curcumin (from Turmeric)**

This powerful anti-inflammatory supports reduced body fat and visceral inflammation, helping your body manage weight more effectively.

**14. Cinnamon**

Cinnamon helps improve insulin sensitivity, which is essential for blood sugar balance and helps reduce overall blood pressure.

**15. Monk Fruit**

A natural, zero-calorie sweetener that does not spike blood sugar, making it an ideal flavor enhancer for anyone watching their glucose levels.

**16. Natural Lemon & Mint Flavor**

These natural flavors make Cardio Slim Tea enjoyable to drink daily, while offering light digestive benefits and a refreshing finish.
